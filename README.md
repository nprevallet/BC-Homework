# BC-Homework

Bootcamp repository where assignments will be turned in for NPrevallet.

My motivation for creating this repository, is so that I can keep an organized place where my homework projects and assignments will live for the UoA Bootcamp.

This project was built for some of the previous reasons already provided. The problem this solves is to have a location for ease of access for viewing changes to code on homework assignments on the fly. In this process I've learned much more about Git and the purpose of a repo.

## Usage

For the instructor to view various commits made to homework assignments.

## Credits

I am the only collaborator on this repo.

## License

Collaborators and other developers - do not copy my code or use it as your own.
